# node-express-blog-exercise
A project exercise done with Node.js and Express.js for the Buutti Javascript Trainee Programme

Simple instructions how to get this work:

1. npm install
1. node project.js


Create a user with the user name *admin* and with a password of your choice if you wish to write blog posts. The rest of the registration data is optional, as it is with every created user - although the user names are unique (in other words: once taken, no other user can use that name). Commenting does not require registration. Comments by people not logged in get *(not registered)* added after their user name when posting.


When logged in, registered users are able to click their user name on the home page, and go to the page where they can see the registration details of their account. People can access that page even without logging in, but all they see is the user's selected name. Only the user in question - and admins - can see all the details. Currently the said data can not be modified.
