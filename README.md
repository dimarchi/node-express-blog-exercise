# node-express-blog-exercise
A project exercise done with Node.js and Express.js for the Buutti Javascript Trainee Programme

Simple instructions how to get this work:

1. npm install
1. node project.js


Create a user with the user name *admin* and with a password of your choice if you wish to write blog posts. The rest of the registration data is optional, as it is with every created user - although the user names are unique (in other words: once taken, no other user can use that name). Commenting does not require registration. Comments by people not logged in get *(not registered)* added after their user name when posting.
